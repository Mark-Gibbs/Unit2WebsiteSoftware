                    What is the purpose of IT in modern business?
                </h3>
                Prior to the development of modern technology, businesses operated using a simple trade and barter system, that was very slow, as it required everything to be created by hand. This could be very tiresome if working with physical copies of records, as any changes could result in the entire document needing to be rewritten. This problem became more apparent as businesses became more complex over time, as they expanded. Modern technology allows for an infrastructure to be placed within any business, be it office based, or factory based, which helps automate the tedious processes associated with manufacture and management, that up until this time, had to all be done by hand.

                <h3>
                    What methods, skills and resources are needed to complete digital projects?
                </h3>
                <h4>
                    What tools do you need to make a project successful?
                </h4>
                In order to effectively run a project, it may be necessary to utilise a project management software that allows all members of the team to keep up to date with what is happening in the project, and what subtasks need to be done at the current moment in the projects development lifecycle.<br>In addition to physical software that might be required to manage the project, it is often important to decide on a methodology by which you will run the development of the project. The two most common methodologies that are used during project management are:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Waterfall - This is the 'traditional' way of project management, where each step of the project is handled by a different department or team, and development is only passed on to the next team when the current team has completely finished their work, for example the product cannot be made by the production team, until the idea for the product has been fully thought up.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Agile - This is the 'modern' way of project management, where there are daily meeting held (called Scrum meetings), where all the members of a team meet up, and outline what they have done, are doing, and will do for the course of the day/week.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The agile methodology requires very fast, short 'sprints', where a small part of the overall project will be completed by the end of each cycle, and it will repeat itself multiple times, until the end result is achieved. The waterfall is the complete opposite, where at the end of one cycle, the whole project should be complete, with a fully working end result.
                <h4>
                    What skills do you need to make a project successful?
                </h4>
                The skills needed to effectively manage a project, likely overlap with those, required to manage any team of people:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Good team leading skills - The ability to listen to the people you are in charge of, for the duration of the project.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Good time management skills - The ability to make sure that deadlines are met during the project, so that no stage of the project is held up.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Good communication skills - The ability to communicate what you are working on with your superiors, and your peers.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

                <h3>
                    What risks are there, that might impact digital projects?
                </h3>
                The most basic reason why digital projects fail, is that the initial scope of the project was not fully understood, and caused the project to fail. This can be because not enough people are in the team, for it to operate effectively, putting increasing stress on the few members that are present. It can also be because not enough resources were assigned to the project, for example money, this means that corners will have to be cut during production, which will result in a worse outcome for the project, meaning it has failed. Overall, most of the problems that occur during a project, happen because the first stage of the project was not planned correctly, and problems keep on stacking on top of each other because of it.

                    How would I go about selecting and using IT systems software
                </h3>
                In order to select the right kind of technology for any task, I would outline what type of technology I would need to complete the project, for example, do I want to create word documents that contain information that I may need to refer to later, or send out to clients, if so, I might use software like Microsoft Word, which allows me to do this. Do I want to write code for the project, if so, I might want to use Microsoft Visual Studio, which allows me to write programs in any number of languages. Do I want to work with others, and manage a team, if so, I might want software that allows us to communicate, manage tasks, or share documents/code, if so, I might use GitHub, Discord, or email in order to achieve this.

                <h4>
                    How has Trello helped me plan?
                </h4>
                The online software Trello, allows me to create a management board, to which I can add columns, which I can use to represent the workflow of the project, with a 'to do' column, a 'currently working on' column, and a 'completed' column. To these columns I can add cards, which represent a problem that I need to solve, I can separate a card into multiple different cards, using a combination of tags and columns.<br>This has helped me with breaking down complex problems into simple tasks, which I can easily complete, and combine to form a solution to the complex problem.
                <h4>
                    How can git and GitHub help me with version control?
                </h4>
                Git and GitHub allows me to have a virtual repository of code that is used within a project, which can be used from any location, which doesn't limit me to working on one machine. In addition to functioning as an online repository, GitHub, when used with git, allows me to version my software, which means that I can keep a track of any changes that I make to the code, so that if I wish to undo a change, I don't have to search through hundreds of lines of codes (if the project is that large), I can just look for the version that I uploaded, that contains the content that I wish to edit. Adding source control to a project also allows different people to work on the same piece of code at the same time.

                The regulations set by the GDPR are very strict, and must be followed. The way that this would affect projects, would most likely be during the planning stage, as careful consideration as to how (if necessary) user data will be handled by the finished product. If this is not taken into consideration, the final product will have to be heavily modified, for it to conform to the regulations set by the GDPR.
