                </h3>
                I was pleased with the way in which Visual Studio Code allowed me to easily write fully functioning html, css and javascript files. The colour change for variables, functions, etc. made it very easy for me to locate any errors in the code, and the autocomplete functionality made writing the code much faster.<br>I found Trello very useful for managing the content and development of the website, as I could add, update and move cards, depending on when I have completed them, or need to complete a new task. The spell checking was very useful for when I was writing large amounts of text, as it clearly marked where a word with possible misspelling was.

                </h3>
                It made sense to use Visual Studio Code, as it allowed me to write Javascript, html, and css files, without having to run multiple different code editors, as VS Code allows all 3 to be developed at the same time in one working environment. The additional debug and error checking functionality was also useful, as it provided assistance during development.<br>While developing the solution, it was necessary for me to provide a chart, that allowed me to track my progress through the project lifecycle. Trello seemed like an appropriate solution to this, as it allowed me to separate the main problem into many smaller problems that could be easily completed, and combined later. In addition to the general management of the project, it also provided a basic spell checker, that helped with writing out large sections of text (such as this), which I could then add to the solution, if any written sections were required.

                </h3>
                Overall, I am pleased with the website, It has a solid structure to it, with the different layers of headings (main/sub) clearly distinguishable from each other. The width of everything is percentage based, so it can squash and stretch with little incident. I believe the colour scheme I came up with is pretty good too, with white text on a black background, as I believe this to be easier on the eyes, than black text on a white background, I also like the rainbow of colours used in the background of the website, but I'm not sure it fits the purpose of the website (it was mostly done to make it look more interesting, and to stand out). I like the addition I put in of drop down expandable text boxes in the legal guidelines section, as this made it stand out more, and allowed me to display some skill, greater than simply formatting a website.<br>So in conclusion, I do like the website, it's clear to read, and fairly fancy-looking, but there are one or two things I'm not 100% happy with.

                </h3>
                As I mentioned in the previous section, I'm not entirely happy with the way that I have used the rainbow colouring in the background to make the page seem more exciting, it looks ok as it is, but it sort of draws your attention to the sides of the screen, even though I originally put them there to fill up the empty space. A possible way that I have though of improving this is by perhaps using the colours I have set inside the section that creates the background rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet) as separate colours, that are each used to provide the background for the titles and subtitles. This might help draw peoples attention to each of the individual sections, while still providing colour for the website, while also maintaining the black background and white text that I believe makes it easier to read.<br>An improvement that I might want to add to the website, would be a top menu, as this would help to further show my abilities, but since the website is just one page, this would be superfluous.

                </h3>
                The website was supposed to be a blog talking about our knowledge of technology, with roughly a paragraph of information about several subjects. As you can see from my website, I have formatted it so that each section is clearly outlined, and I have provided a paragraph of information for each section, where I have demonstrated my knowledge on each topic, so I believe the website does what it is supposed to do.

                </h3>
                The most basic way of increasing the efficiency of anything, is to allocate the task to more than one person. Based on the scope of this project, it would be sensible to have no more than 3-4 people in the group, as any more would leave people with less to do, thus not increasing the efficiency, as it would still take the same amount of time. Conversely, a smaller group than this would have a lower efficiency rating, which is ok, but not ideal.

                    Describe ways to increase productivity and efficiency
                </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Track and limit how much time you are spending on tasks - It is difficult to accurately estimate the passage of time, and you can find that what you thought you were working on for an hour, can easily turn into 3 or 4 hours, use a clock or a timer to count how long you are spending on tasks, so that you don't spend to much time on a task.</li>
                    <li>Take regular breaks - Constantly working on a task causes anyone to become tired, and as a result, they will put in less effort to their work. Utilising small breaks, allows time for the brain to reset.</li>
                    <li>Set self-imposed deadlines - When working on a project or task with no specific due date, it is important to set yourself a deadline, so that you don't wall into the mentality of 'I'll do it later'.</li>
                    <li>Follow the "two-minute rule" - According to entrepreneur Steve Olenski, if you have a task that can be done in two minutes, it should be done immediately, as it will take less time to complete, and moving it to a later date actually causes it to take longer to be done.</li>
                    <li>Just say no to meetings - While meetings are seen as a formality, and attending/setting them is seen as a sign of respect for fellow workers, the actual time spent on superfluous meetings can greatly eat away at an overall projects time, to rectify this, it may be just as easy to convey the information in a meeting via email or any other messaging software.</li>
                    <li>Hold standing meetings - - If group meetings are required, it might be productive to have everyone standing up, as this makes them more active and engaged in what's being said.</li>
                    <li>Quit multitasking - While people like to believe that they can perform multiple tasks at once, it has been proven that this is not the case, attempting to multitask, will end up taking more time than if someone had done each task one by one.</li>
                    <li>Take advantage of your commute - For people that commute via public transport (bus, tram, train), they can use this time to check work emails, or plan what you are going to do.</li>
                    <li>Give up on the illusion of perfection - Many people spend so much time after completing a task, endlessly tweaking it to make it 'perfect'. This process can continue forever, as it's impossible to create a perfect result, instead tasks should be done to the best of a persons ability, not to perfection.</li>
                    <li>Take exercise breaks - The process of 'getting your blood pumping' also helps to increase your brain activity, making you more productive at work.</li>
                    <li>Be proactive, not reactive - Try not to spend the day responding to emails and phone calls, as at the end of the day, nothing will have been achieved.</li>
                    <li>Turn off notifications - It can be very easy to keep picking up your phone to look at notifications, be it direct messages, or from things you're subscribed to. To mitigate the effect that notifications have on your work flow, just turn them off.</li>
                    <li>Work in 90-minute intervals - Working at a consistently high level for extended periods of time, causes people to become tired, and for their productivity to decrease over time. Working in intervals of 90 minutes, permeated by breaks of 10 minutes (see 2), helps to maintain the high level of productivity for 'longer' periods of time.</li>
                    <li>Give yourself something nice to look at - Working in a plain, drab office environment causes people subconsciously become demotivated over time, thus reducing productivity, adding a bit of colour, or some nice decorations about the place, allows people to stay motivated, and maintain high levels of productivity.</li>
                    <li>Minimise interruptions (to the best of your ability) - There are many miscellaneous interruptions to a persons work flow, such as co-workers popping by to ask them a question, or simply loud or sudden noises outside that may throw off someones concentration, halting their work, and reducing productivity.
                    </li>

                In order to increase the productivity in the project, I would probably assign the project to a team, with myself included, as any project when undertaken with multiple people will take less time to complete, as the different subtasks can be delegated out to the different members. In order to effectively communicate with the different members of the team, I would utilise an online messaging software, such as Slack to communicate with them, and relay tasks, and solutions with them.

                In order to get feedback about my website, I would send it out to a set amount of people to test, among other things, the functionality and readability of the website. It is important to do third party testing, as having developed the website, I know what to do, and where different sections of text are, so I might not be reading the website to see this information, but rather using my memory of where it is. Having other people test the website is useful, as they have not encountered it before, so they will have to focus on the website itself for information, and if they are not able to do this easily, I can fix the problem.

                    <li>Underneath the headings and subheadings are blocks of text, which takes up the largest portion of the website, and uses the fourth largest font.</li>
                    <li>In the sixth section are 8 buttons, all layered on top of each other, which display a small piece of text, which is a small description of an item in a list, when any of the buttons is pressed, a longer description 'drops down' below it, when the button is pressed, the longer description 'rolls up'.</li>
                    <li>At the bottom of the website is a footer, which contains links to the Trello board, and the review document (this).</li>

                There are different copyright laws for different regions, but they share similarities.<br>In the US, the Copyright Act of 1976 grants authors and artists the exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, and display their works.

This doesn't inherently protect websites, the Copyright (Computer Programs) Regulations 1992 extends this protection to websites.<br>In both the UK and the US, websites automatically gain copyright protection upon creation, although it is highly recommended to register the website with the U.K. Copyright Service, and the U.S. Copyright Office respectively, as websites are subject to abuse, and that process allows a civil cause of action.

                </h3>
                Blindness is one of the obvious disabilities that can cause a user problems when trying to view a website. The user may use a speech output system, that will read the text on the screen, and output this information as audio. They may also use a braille output system, which functions in a similar way to speech output systems, except that it will output the information into a braille display area. While these systems can easily translate text, they cannot translate graphical elements of the website, because of this, it would be necessary to add a text description below graphical elements, so that the user will be able to get some information about the image.<br>Along the same lines as blindness, is vision loss. This includes disabilities such as hazy vision, low vision colour blindness, tunnel vision, near sightedness. Users with these conditions have difficulty seeing low contrast colours, small icons, or small text. The solutions for improving the accessibility of the website, for people with this disability, includes the solutions for people with blindness, but you can also make text and icons scalable, as well as having different colour options, with higher contrast colours.<br>Users affected by colour blindness will have difficulty differentiating text from its background, if there isn't enough contrast between the two. To remove this problem, match text with backgrounds that have a clear colour difference, e.g. black and white.<br>Users who are deaf or hard of hearing cannot hear audio, or system prompts. Users with this problem, usually make changes in their operating system, so that audio prompts are replaced by screen flashes.<br>Physical disabilities, such as arthritis, are those that prevent a user from effectively using their body. Users with this disability might experience difficulty selecting small buttons with the mouse, and may rely on using the keyboard to navigate the whole page. Try not to use buttons that are small, or include an option that enlarges all the buttons on the page, so that users can easily select them.<br>Learning disabilities are often overlooked, but pose a user just as much of a problem as any other disability. Users with learning disabilities may have difficulty with a web site that does not use clear language, or has complex vocabulary or sentences. If a page is not logically structured, the user may also have difficulty navigating it. Users with learning difficulties may find it easier to read the content of a website in a different format, such as audio. Therefore the solutions for deaf and blind users will help people with learning disabilities.<br>Overall, being able to provide the information on the website in different formats will help many people with disabilities that prevent them from using it as it is, will allow them to view it anyway.
